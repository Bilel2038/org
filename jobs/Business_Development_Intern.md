## BigchainDB & Benefits

We're a tight-knit international team based in Berlin. We’re always building and shipping, but with an appreciation for the theoretical. We work closely with our users, technology partners, and engage with the global decentralization community on and offline.
From our very beginnings having a female cofounder: we are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We strongly encourage applications from women, transgender or non-binary people, people of colour, people with disabilities, or anyone traditionally underrepresented in tech.

**Starting Date:** Your stating date would be 3rd September 2018. 

**Location:** We’re in Berlin, Germany. If you don’t know much about Berlin, don’t fret. Almost all of us have immigrated here, from all over the world, from Canada to India, from Italy to USA. And we love it!

**Immigration:** We’ll hold your hand in the visa / immigration process, which is smooth and surprisingly fast.

**Language:** We speak English in the office. And in fact if you only speak English, you can easily get by in Berlin. (As is the case for many of our employees.)

**Time off:** Health first. Without health and happiness, what is left? So, our minimum paid leave per year is 25 days, plus statutory national holidays.

**Professional and Personal Growth:** BigchainDB is at the epicenter of blockchains + big data + AI, so if you’re not learning, then something’s wrong! We’ll be giving you opportunities to represent us speaking at conferences, hosting hackathons, writing, and more. Finally, we give you an annual budget that you choose as you wish to spend on books, personal conferences, and other things to grow yourself.

**Amazing cool city.** Did we mention, it’s Berlin?

**Things work.** Did we mention, it’s Germany?
